# Vector Design Tool
Vector Design Tool is a collaborative project completed by Group 10 (Endgame) for QUT: CAB302 Software Development. The program's general purpose is to create an environment allowing users to draw shapes in differing colours and formats using Java Swing. The shapes drawn by the user in the GUI will be translated into lines of instruction code readable by a CNC machine.
